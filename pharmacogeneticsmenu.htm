<h3 style="margin-top: 10px">ANKK1/DRD2</h3>

<p>Dopamine, a key neurotransmitter that controls cognition, emotion, locomotor activity and other endocrine functions, exerts it action by binding to five different receptors including the dopamine D2 receptor (DRD2). Dysregulation of dopaminergic signal transmission is found in many pathological conditions such as Parkinson&rsquo;s disease and schizophrenia and compounds that act as DRD2 agonists or antagonists are used to treat these conditions. Both therapeutic and adverse events of several antipsychotics result from their high affinity to antagonize DRD2.</p>

<h3 style="margin-top: 10px">Apolipoprotein E</h3>

<p>Apolipoproteins (APO) are structural constituents of lipoprotein particles that have critical roles in blood lipid metabolism and transport. Apolipoprotein E (APOE) is a major constituent of triglyceride-rich chylomicrons, very low- density lipoproteins VLDL and some subclasses of high-density lipoproteins (HDL). Defects in apolipoprotein E (APOE) can result in dyslipidemia, which is an important risk factor in the genesis of atherosclerosis and subsequent development of cardiovascular disease (CVD).</p>

<h3 style="margin-top: 10px">COMT</h3>

<p>Catechol-O-Methyltransferase (COMT) is an enzyme responsible for the metabolism of catecholamines and catechol- estrogens in both the central nervous system and other organs. Dopamine is cleared mainly by COMT in the frontal cortex and a reduced activity of this enzyme results in higher synaptic levels of dopamine, which affects prefontal cortex cognitive response to certain drugs. A single nucleotide polymorphism of the COMT gene produces an amino acid change from valine to methionine (Val158Met) and reduces the enzyme activity by 3 to 4 fold.</p>

<h3 style="margin-top: 10px">CYP1A2</h3>

<p>The cytochrome P450 1A2 (CYP1A2) accounts for 13% of total CYP in the human liver and is responsible for metabolizing 8-10% of commonly used drugs as well as natural compounds such as caffeine. A large inter-individual variability in the elimination of drugs that are metabolized by CYP1A2 has been observed, which has been ascribed to both genetic variations and environmental factors. CYP1A2 activity is highly inducible (increased) by environmental factors including smoking (tobacco), some drugs and several dietary compounds (cruciferous vegetables). The following drugs used in the management of pain and various psychiatric conditions are metabolized extensively by CYP1A2 and are sensitive to its function: Clozapine (Clozaril), Duloxetine (Cymbalta), Olazapine (Zyprexa) and Tizanidine (Zanaflex). CYP1A2 metabolizes also other important drugs such as Ondansetron (Zofran), Ramelteon (Rozerem), and Ropivacaine (Naropin). CYP1A2 metabolism is highly sensitive to inhibition and induction and the occurrence of drug-drug interactions can have profound effects on the pharmacokinetics, the response and safety profiles of many CYP1A2 drug substrates.</p>

<h3 style="margin-top: 10px">CYP2B6</h3>

<p>The Cytochrome P450 2B6 (CYP2B6) is involved in the metabolism of 4% of clinically important medications. This enzyme is highly polymorphic and to date, 37 different variants have been identified. The CYP2B6 assay identifies some common variants that are associated with variability in enzyme activity. CYP2B6 plays a role in the metabolism of the following drugs: Artemisinin, Bupropion (Wellbutrin), Cyclophosphamide (Cytoxan), Efavirenz (Sustiva), Ketamine (Ketalar), Meperidine (Demerol), Methadone (Dolophine), Nevirapine (Viramune), Propofol (Diprivan) and Selegiline (Eldepryl). The impact of CYP2B*6 polymorphism on the pharmacokinetics as well as the clinical response have been studied in patients taking methadone, bupropion and efavirenz. Limited evidence exists regarding the clinical impact of other polymorphisms. Inhibitors or Inducers of CYP2B6 enzyme may modify its activity and change the patient&rsquo;s metabolizer status. This can result in drug-drug interactions when a drug substrate is prescribed with known CYP2B6 inhibitors or inducers.</p>

<h3 style="margin-top: 10px">CYP2C19</h3>

<p>The Cytochrome P450 2C19 (CYP2C19) is involved in the metabolism of 10% of clinically important medications. This enzyme is highly polymorphic and more than 30 different variant alleles have been identified. The CYP2C19 assay identifies some common variants that are associated with variability in CYP2C19 enzyme activity, which has important pharmacological and toxicological implications for antidepressants, benzodiazepines, antiplatelets and proton-pump Inhibitors. There is substantial evidence linking the CYP2C19 polymorphisms to variability in the pharmacological and safety profiles of the following therapies used in psychiatric conditions and pain management: Amitriptyline (Elavil), Sertraline (Zoloft), Clobazam (Onfi), Citalopram (Celexa), Escitalopram (Lexapro), Diazepam (Valium), Imipramine (Tofranil), Carisoprodol (soma). CYP2C19 This plays a minor role in the elimination of Methadone (Dolophine). Cardiovascular medications that are metabolized by CYP2C19 include the prodrug Clopidogrel (Plavix), Propranolol (Inderal) and Cilostazol (Pletal). Proton-pump Inhibitors like Omeprazole (Prilosec), Esomeprazole (Nexium), Lansoprazole (Prevacid), Dexlansoprazole (Dexilant), pantoprazole (Protonix), are major substrates of CYP2C19. Inhibitors or Inducers of CYP2C19 enzyme may modify its activity and change the patient&rsquo;s metabolizer status. This can result in drug-drug interactions when a drug substrate is prescribed with known CYP2C19 inhibitors or inducers.</p>

<h3 style="margin-top: 10px">CYP2C9</h3>

<p>The cytochrome P450 2C9 (CYP2C9) is involved in the metabolism of 15% of clinically important medications. This enzyme is highly polymorphic and to date, 30 different variants have been identified. The CYP2C9 assay identifies some common variants that are associated with variability in CYP2C9 enzyme activity, which has important pharmacological and toxicological implications for anticonvulsants, anticoagulants and certain antidiabetics. CYP2C9 plays a role in the metabolism of the following psychotropic drugs: fluoxetine (Prozac), Phenytoin (Dilantin), and Primidone (Mysoline). Several NSAIDs and Cox-2 inhibitors are substrates of CYP2C9 and patients with reduced CYP2C9 activity may have higher plasma levels of Celecoxib (Celebrex), Flurbiprofen (Ocufen), Piroxicam (Feldene), Meloxicam (Mobic). CYP2C9 plays a minor role in the elimination of Diclofenac (Voltaren), Sulindac (Clinoril) and Naproxen (Aleve). Cardiovascular medications that are metabolized by CYP2C9 include warfarin (Coumadin), Fluvastatin (Lescol), Losartan (Cozaar) and Irbesartan (Avapro). Other important drugs metabolized by CYP2C9 include antidiabetics like Tolbutamide, Glibeclamide (Micronase), Glipizide (Glucotrol) and Nateglinide (Starlix). Inhibitors or Inducers of CYP2C9 enzyme may modify its activity and change the patient&rsquo;s metabolizer status. This can result in drug-drug interactions when a drug substrate is prescribed with known CYP2C9 inhibitors or inducers.</p>

<h3 style="margin-top: 10px">CYP2D6</h3>

<p>The Cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) is involved in the metabolism of 25% of clinically important medications. This enzyme is highly polymorphic and more than 100 different variants have been identified. The CYP2D6 assay identifies common variants that are associated variability in CYP2D6 enzyme activity, which has important pharmacological and toxicological implications for antidepressants, antipsychotics, opioids, beta-blockers and antiarrhythmics. There is substantial evidence linking the CYP2D6 polymorphisms to variability in the pharmacological and safety profiles of the following psychotropics: Desipramine (Norpramin), Imipramine (Tofranil), Amitriptyline (Elavil), Nortriptyline (Pamelor), Haloperidol (Haldol), Trimipramine (Surmontil), Venlafaxine (Effexor), Doxepin (Silenor), Aripiprazole (Abilify), Atomoxetine (Strattera), Duloxetine (Cymbalta), Risperidone (Risperdal), Clomipramine (Anafranil) and Pimozide (Orap). CYP2D6 polymorphisms have been shown to affect the pharmacological and safety profiles of the following analgesics: Codeine, Tramadol (Ultram), Hydrocodone (Vicodin). Codeine and tramadol are pro-drugs that need to be activated by CYP2D6. Poor metabolizers are at high risk of therapy failure when given codeine or tramadol. On the other hand, rapid metabolizers may experience increased toxicity when given standard dosage of codeine and tramadol. Because CYP3A4 is also involved in the metabolism of oxycodone, patients with abnormal CYP2D6 activity may still experience adequate analgesia when taking this drug. CYP2D6 polymorphism has been shown to affect dihydrocodeine (Synalgos-DC) pharmacokinetics and can potentially alter the response to this drug. Morphine, Oxymorphone (Opana), Hydromorphone (Dilaudid), Butorphanol (Stadol), Fentanyl (Duragesic), Buprenorphine (Butrans), Methadone (Dolophine), Morphine (Avinza) and Tapentadol (Nucynta) are not substrates of CYP2D6 and the patient&rsquo;s response to these drugs is not expected to be affected by polymorphisms in this enzyme.</p>

<h3 style="margin-top: 10px">CYP3A4/CYP3A5</h3>

<p>The cytochrome P450 3A4 and 3A5 (CYP3A4 and CYP3A5) account for 40-80% of total CYP in human liver and intestine, respectively. Most importantly, CYP3A enzymes metabolize 50% of commonly used drugs. CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 enzymes have overlapping substrate specificity and the contribution of CYP3A5 in the overall metabolism is smaller than the one for CYP3A4. The overall CYP3A metabolism status is expected to affect drugs that have a narrow therapeutic index. CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 genotypes can help identify patients with high or low overall CYP3A activity. Although these two enzymes metabolize many drugs, the response of only a few (like narrow therapeutic index drugs) is expected to change significantly by genetic polymorphisms. Fentanyl (Duragesic) is a narrow therapeutic drug that is mainly metabolized by CYP3A. There is limited evidence suggesting that the response to this drug is altered in individuals with abnormal CYP3A activity. The following drugs used in pain management and various psychiatric conditions are metabolized extensively by CYP3A: Fentanyl (Duragesic), Oxycodone (Oxycontin) and Buprenorphine (Suboxone), Carbamazepine (Tegretol), Quetiapine (Seroquel), Ziprasidone (Geodon), Alprazolam (Xanax), Midazolam (Versed), Triazolam (Halcion), Nefazodone (Serzone), Trazodone (Oleptro), Vilazodone (Vibryd), Zaleplon (Sonata) and Zolpidem (Ambien). CYP3A contributes to a small extent in the elimination of Methadone (Dolophine). Within the major therapeutic classes used in cardiovascular conditions, the following drugs are substantially metabolized by CYP3A: Atorvastatin (Lipitor), Simvastatin (Zocor), Lovastatin (Mevacor), Nifedipine (Procardia), Verapamil (Verelan), Nicardipine (cardene), Felodipine (Plendil), Nisoldipine (Sular),Clopidogrel (Plavix), Prasugrel (Effient), Ticagrelor (Brilinta), Cilostazol (Pletal), Amiodarone (cordarone), Quinidine (qualaquin), Disopyramide (Norpace), Losartan (Cozaar), Rivaroxaban (xarelto), Apixaban (Eliquis). CYP3A metabolism is highly sensitive to inhibition and induction when a patient is taking multiple drugs. Then occurrence of drug-drug interactions can have profound effects on the pharmacokinetics, the response and safety profiles of many CYP3A drug substrates.</p>

<h3 style="margin-top: 10px">Factor II</h3>

<p>Clotting Factor II, or prothrombin, is a vitamin K&ndash;dependent proenzyme that functions in the blood coagulation cascade. It is a precursor to thrombin, which converts fibrinogen into fibrin, which in turn strengthens a protective clot. The prothrombin 20210G&gt;A mutation in the Factor II gene, results in increased levels of plasma prothrombin and a concurrent increased risk for thrombosis. Prothrombin-related thrombophilia is characterized by venous thromboembolism (VTE). This risk of thrombosis is also increased when mutations exist for other coagulation factors such as Factor V Leiden or in presence of non-genetic risk factors such as obesity, injury, surgery, smoking, pregnancy, use of estrogen-containing contraceptive or replacement therapy. The clinical expression of Factor II thrombophilia is variable and many individuals may never develop thrombosis while others may experience venous thrombotic events or pregnancy complications. The Factor II 20210G&gt;A mutation, is associated with an elevation of plasma prothrombin levels to about 30 % above normal in heterozygotes and to 70% above normal in homozygotes. Heterozygotes are at a 2- to 5-fold increased risk of an initial VTE. The risk for VTE in Factor II 20210G&gt;A homozygotes is not well defined, but presumed to be higher than in 20210G&gt;A heterozygotes. Factor II 20210G&gt;A homozygotes tend to develop thrombosis more frequently and at a younger age. Individuals who are doubly heterozygotes for Factor V Leiden and Factor II 20210G&gt;A have an estimated 20-fold increased risk when compared to individuals without either mutation, suggesting a multiplicative elevation in risk. Certain circumstantial factors can increase the risk of thrombosis and include: travel, central venous catheter use, pregnancy, oral contraceptive use, hormone replacement therapy (HRT), selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs), organ transplantation, injury, age, and surgery.</p>

<h3 style="margin-top: 10px">Factor V Leiden</h3>

<p>The Factor V gene encodes the coagulation factor V. In normal conditions, Factor V is inactivated during the clotting process by the activated protein C (APC). In subjects with Factor V Leiden thrombophilia, a mutation in the gene produces a Factor V that cannot be inactivated normally by APC and as a result, the clotting process remains active longer than usual leading to more thrombin generation. This hypercoagulable state is also increased when other mutations exist on other coagulation factors such as Factor II or in presence of non-genetic risk factors such as obesity, injury, surgery, smoking, pregnancy, use of estrogen-containing contraceptive or replacement therapy. The clinical expression of Factor V Leiden thrombophilia is variable. Many individuals may never develop thrombosis while others may experience venous thrombotic events or pregnancy complications. Certain circumstantial factors can increase the risk of thrombosis and include: travel, central venous catheter use, pregnancy, oral contraceptive use, hormone replacement therapy (HRT), selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs), organ transplantation, injury, age, and surgery. These factors are associated with the first thrombotic episode in at least 50% of individuals with a Factor V Leiden mutation. About 1 in 1000 people in the U.S. experience a first venous thromboembolism (VTE) each year. VTE is caused by both inherited and environmental factors and while the Factor V Leiden mutation is present in only 15-20% of individuals with a first VTE, it is found in 50% of individuals with recurrent VTE or estrogen-related thrombosis.</p>

<h3 style="margin-top: 10px">MTHFR</h3>

<p>Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) is involved in folate metabolism and is essential for the remethylation of homocysteine. Two common mutations in the MTHFR gene: 677C&gt;T and 1298A&gt; result in an enzyme with decreased activity, which is linked to increased plasma homocysteine levels (I.e. hyperhomocysteinemia). Mild to moderate hyperhomocysteinemia has been identified as a risk factor for venous thromboembolism and other cardiovascular diseases such as coronary heart disease and stroke. Other conditions in which hyperhomocysteinemia is found include recurrent pregnancy loss, placental infarction and birth defects. However, the causal role of MTHFR mutations in these conditions is not well established.</p>

<h3 style="margin-top: 10px">OPRM1</h3>

<p>&ldquo;Mu&rdquo; opioid Receptors are the most important site of action of opioid drugs. Single polymorphisms in the human mu- opioid receptor (OPRM1) have been investigated for their role in human nociception, opiate efficacy and addiction.</p>

<h3 style="margin-top: 10px">SLCO1B1</h3>

<p>The SLCO1B1 gene encodes a liver-specific transporter involved in the removal of endogenous compounds (bile acids, bilirubin) and drugs such as statins from the blood to the liver. Some variants of the SLCO1B1 gene result in a low-functioning protein, which impairs statin clearance and may lead to an increased risk of muscle pain, tenderness or weakness, called myopathy. Certain medications can potently inhibit SLCO1B1 causing clinically significant drug interactions.</p>

<h3 style="margin-top: 10px">VKORC1</h3>

<p>The Vitamin K epoxide reductase complex, subunit 1 (VKORC1) is the target of anticoagulants. This enzyme is the rate-limiting step in the vitamin K cycle. Mutations in the VKORC1 gene results in variable expression levels of the VKORC1 enzyme and altered sensitivities towards anticoagulants. VKORC1 genotype defines three levels of clinical phenotypes, a high sensitivity, a moderate sensitivity and low sensitivity phenotypes towards warfarin a widely used anticoagulant. Therefore, VKORC1 variant testing is usually used in conjunction with CYP2C9 variant testing to optimize warfarin dosing and minimize the risks of bleeding or thrombotic complications.</p>
