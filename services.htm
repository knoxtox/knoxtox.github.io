<h3>Toxicology &amp; Pharmacogenetics</h3>

<p>We offer healthcare professionals the choice of toxicology testing via urine or oral fluid (saliva). PGX testing is done using a simple buccal cheek swab to extract DNA. It is KTM&#39;s goal to provide clinicians with state-of-the-art toxicology, high-throughput DNA analysis, concise reports and provider support. We enable providers to give their patients individualized treatment plans for personalized care and reduce overall healthcare costs.</p>
